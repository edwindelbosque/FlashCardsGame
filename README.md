### Summary

FlashCards is a mini-game project that focuses on solely using JavaScript and the terminal. The learning goals for this project was to be able to successfully contribute to a partially constructed object-oriented application and to follow a spec to make it a working application. The project consists mainly of different classes accross different files with their properties and methods and this project taught me how to be more efficient at connecting classes through methods. I also implemented ES6 tools like arrow functions (=>), classes, let & const, .map, spread operators, among other tools.
When the round is complete, you will be prompted with the percentage of cards you got correct throughout the match.

FlashCards has also an emphasis on the implementation of a more robust testing suite using TDD (Test Driven Development).
The testing suite tests all of the functionality of the game, including:
- Class default properties
- Class methods
- Anything that updates class properties

### Languages and Libraries Used
- **JavaScript ES6:** Modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- **Testing Suite: Chai & Mocha**
