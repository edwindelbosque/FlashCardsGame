### Summary

FlashCards is a mini-game project that focuses on solely using JavaScript and the terminal. The learning goals for this project was to be able to successfully contribute to a partially constructed object-oriented application and to follow a spec to make it a working application. I also implemented ES6 elements like arrow functions (=>), classes, let & const, .map, spread operators, among others.

FlashCards has also an emphasis on implement a robust testing suite using TDD (Test Driven Development).
The testing suite tests all of the functionality of the game, including:
- Class default properties
- Class methods
- Anything that updates class properties

### Languages and Libraries Used
- **JavaScript ES6:** Modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- **Testing: Chai & Mocha**
